# DetExploit v0.1 (Alpha Version)

![ScreenShot1](sshot1.png)

## Abstract

DetExploit is software that detect vulnerable applications on the system, and notify them to user.

As we know, most of cyberattacks uses vulnerability that is released out year before.

I thought this is huge problem, and this kind of technology should be more powerful than technology that will detect unknown malwares or exploits.

Also this project is also planned to be my Mitou Jr program in Japan.

I wish and work hard to make this an huge OSS (Open Source Software) project, to help these days society.
